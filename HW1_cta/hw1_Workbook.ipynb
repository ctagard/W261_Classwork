    "> __a)__ The bias-variance trade-off in machine learning refers to the balance between a model's simplicity (high bias, low variance) and its capacity to fit data noise (low bias, high variance). When decomposing total prediction error, it can be expressed as $\\text{Error} = \\text{Bias}^2 + \\text{Variance} + \\text{Irreducible Error}$, where Bias is the error from erroneous assumptions, Variance is the error from model's sensitivity to small fluctuations, and Irreducible Error is the noise in the data. In machine learning, understanding this trade-off aids in model selection and regularization. Overly complex models may have low bias but high variance, leading to overfitting; whereas too simple models may have high bias but low variance, leading to underfitting. Adjusting model complexity helps achieve an optimal balance between these errors, enhancing generalization on unseen data.

    "# Question 3: Tokenizing\n",
    "A number of our assignments this term will involve extracting information from text. A common preprocessing step when working with raw files is to 'tokenize' (i.e. extract words from) the text. Within the field of Natural Language Processing a lot of thought goes into what specific tokenizing makes most sense for a given task. For example, you might choose to remove punctuation or to consider punctuation symbols  'tokens' in their own right. __In this question you'll use the Python `re` module to create a tokenizer to use when you perform Word Count on the _Alice In Wonderland_ text.__\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* __a) Short Essay on Digital Campus:__ In the Naive Bayes algorithm (which we'll implement next week), we'll estimate the _likelihood_ of a word by counting the number of times it appears and dividing by the size of the vocabulary (total number of unique words). Using the text: *\"Alice had an adventure that took alice to wonderland\"*, give a concrete example of how two different tokenizers could cause us to get two different results on this calculation. [`HINT`: _you should not need to read up on Naive Bayes to answer this question._]  \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) Multiple Choice on Digital Campus:__ When tokenizing in this assignment we'll remove punctuation and discard numerical digits by making everything lowercase and then capturing only consecutive letters a to z. Suppose __`tokenize(x)`__ is a Python function that performs the desired tokenization. What would __`tokenize(\"By-the-bye, what became of Alice's 12 hats?!\")`__ output? ['by', 'the', 'bye', 'what', 'became', 'of', 'alice', 's', 'hats']\n",

    "\n",
    "* __c) code:__  Fill in the regular expression pattern in the cell labeled `part c` so that the subsequent call to `re.findall(RE_PATTERN, ...)` returns the tokenization described above. [`HINT`: _we've taken care of the lowercase part for you. If regex is new to you, check out the [`re`  documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) or [this PyMOTW tutorial](https://pymotw.com/2/re/)._]"

    "> __a)__ Using a case sensitive tokenizer, the provided sentence would utilize the following tokens: [\"Alice\", \"had\", \"an\", \"adventure\", \"that\", \"took\", \"alice\", \"to\", \"wonderland\"], where the likelyhood of the word \"alice\" is 1/9. However, if we were to utilize a stop word tokenizer so that basic words like \"the\", \"an\", and \"to\" were removed from the text string, then we would end up with the following tokens:  [\"alice\", \"had\", \"adventure\", \"that\", \"took\", \"wonderland\"] and \"alice\" would have a likelyhood of 1/6.

The bash script itself served as our '_framework_' -- it split up the original input, then ___mapped___ our word counting script on to each chunk, then ___aggregated (a.k.a. reduced)___ the resulting files by piping them into our collation script. Unfortunately, as you may have realized already, there is a major scalability concern with this particular implementation. __In this question you'll fix our implementation of parallel word count so that it will be scalable.__\n",

If the vocabulary is too large to fit on a single computer, we might split the word counts in half after sorting them, then perform the reducing on two separate machines. Explain what could go wrong with this approach. (For now, ignore the question of how we'd sort a dataset that is too large to fit on a single machine and just focus on what might be wrong about the result of this split-in-half reducing).\n",
